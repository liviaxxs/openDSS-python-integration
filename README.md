# OpenDSS–Python Integration

This repository documents my **weekly progress** in an undergraduate research project focused on the **automation and control of OpenDSS simulations using Python**.

The project is part of my undergraduate research activities and aims to integrate power system distribution simulations with computational tools for data extraction, analysis, and future application of intelligent algorithms.

## Project Overview
The main objective is to enable programmatic interaction with OpenDSS through Python, allowing:
- Automated execution of distribution system simulations  
- Control and configuration of network parameters  
- Extraction of electrical variables for analysis  
- Structuring data for future applications in fault analysis and intelligent methods  

## Current Status
This repository is **under active development** and reflects my learning and progress on a weekly basis.  
At this stage, it includes:
- Initial setup of the OpenDSS–Python interface  
- First automation scripts  
- Exploration of simulation control and data extraction  

New features and improvements are added as the project evolves.

## Technologies
- Python  
- OpenDSS  
- Power distribution system simulation  
- Scientific computing tools

## Notes
This project prioritizes **learning, experimentation, and documentation of progress**, rather than a final consolidated product.
